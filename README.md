## About Me

I'm a bioengineer with a strong academic foundation and hands-on experience in bioinformatics, currently pursuing my MSc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology at Gebze Technical University. I’m passionate about applying Python programming, molecular simulations, and web-based tool development to solve real-world biological problems.

I enjoy contributing to national research projects and interdisciplinary teams, constantly expanding my skills and collaborating with others. My main interests lie in computational biology, protein-ligand interactions, and structural bioinformatics. My goal is to advance effective scientific research and innovative biotech solutions.
